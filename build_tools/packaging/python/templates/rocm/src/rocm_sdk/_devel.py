"""Manages the rocm-sdk-devel package.

The devel package is special in some key ways:

* Since it contains distribution (wheel) unsafe files like symlinks, it is
  distributed under the `rocm_sdk_devel` package as a `_devel.tar` or
  `_devel.tar.xz` file that is intended to be expanded on use.
* This tarball is intended to be expanded into the site-lib directory that
  contains the ROCM distribution packages and will result in a top-level
  python package named like `_rocm_sdk_devel_linux_x86_64` that is a sibling
  to other packages like `_rocm_sdk_core_linux_x86_64`.
* For any files already contained in one of the runtime packages, a relative
  symlink to the correct sibling will be stored.
* Any files not in one of the runtime packages will be included verbatim in the
  tarball.
* RPATH setup relies on this sibling behavior and is already encoded properly
  in the runtime packages.

In order to make this work, we dynamically extend the distribution package on
use, modifying the dist-info RECORD file to include all newly expanded files in
accordance with the PyPA documentation:
  https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/recording-installed-packages/
Note that this puts us in the category of creating a self-modifying package,
which is strongly discouraged but not prohibited. We deem the tradeoff worth
it, as the alternative is to increase the package size by 2-5x and break
symlink relationships.
