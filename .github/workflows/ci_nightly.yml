# This CI workflow is triggered by:
#   - scheduled run
#
# In the scheduled run, we run all targets from amdgpu_family_matrix.py and amdgpu_family_matrix_xfail.py
# As some of these builds are xfail, we allow errors to occur with `continue-on-error`, where the job will fail but the workflow is green
